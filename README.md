Taipei-3
========

I work in 1st, live in 2nd, and try new things in this 3rd city of Taipei.

In this base, I evaluate new things by provision virtual environments in
[Vagrant][vagrant] via various kinds of automation tools such as
[Ansible][ansible], and plain old shell scripts. These automation serves as
documents for me to take records on how to use these new things.
